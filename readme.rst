This repo is to store and not lose, by far the coolest and my most loved project, implmenting soft body simulations using Extended Position Based Dynamics.

The project comprised of 2 parts:

-  Implementing a remeshing to convert 2D surface meshes to 3D volumetric tetrahedral meshes. This was done by implementing Delaunay Triangulation method extended to 3D
-  Implementing Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD) simulation engine to the above 3D meshes.

More details about it can be found in my `Final Report <https://archive.blender.org/wiki/2024/wiki/User:AarnavDhanuka/GSoC2022/FinalReport.html>`__
